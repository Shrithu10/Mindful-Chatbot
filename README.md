# Mindful Chatbot

## Overview
Mindful Chatbot is designed to provide mental health support to students through an engaging, AI-powered conversational interface. In today’s fast-paced academic environment, students often experience high levels of stress and anxiety, leading to mental health challenges. Our chatbot aims to address this critical issue by offering a safe and supportive space where students can seek advice, find resources, and engage in interactive activities that promote mental well-being.

## How Does Your Project Solve This Challenge?
The Mindful Chatbot offers an easy-to-access platform where students can ask questions related to their mental health and receive immediate, empathetic responses. It combines interactive features, such as games and resources, to create a holistic approach to mental wellness. The chatbot provides not only answers to specific queries but also positive affirmations and suggestions for mindfulness exercises. This interactive approach helps to alleviate feelings of isolation and provides students with tools to manage stress effectively.

By simulating a conversation with a compassionate entity, the Mindful Chatbot helps users feel understood and supported. The inclusion of games and mindfulness resources encourages users to engage actively with their mental health, making the process of seeking help less daunting and more approachable.

## Why is GenAI the Best Way to Solve It?
Generative AI, such as Google’s Gemini, is ideal for this project because it allows for dynamic, contextually relevant responses tailored to each user's needs. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on pre-defined scripts, GenAI can generate nuanced and empathetic replies that reflect the complexity of human emotions. This capability enables the chatbot to engage in meaningful conversations with users, making it a valuable resource for those seeking mental health support.

Moreover, the adaptability of GenAI means that as the chatbot interacts with more users, it can improve its responses over time, continuously enhancing the user experience. The model's capacity to understand and respond to diverse emotional states allows it to serve a broad spectrum of student needs effectively.

## Summary of Project Scope

**In-Scope:**
- AI-driven conversations addressing mental health queries.
- Interactive games and activities designed for stress relief.
- Access to resources, including articles and positive videos that promote mental health awareness.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Personalized therapy sessions or replacement of professional mental health services.
- Collection of sensitive personal data beyond basic interaction needs to ensure user privacy and confidentiality.

## Future Opportunities
Future enhancements could include features such as voice interaction, mood tracking, and personalized recommendations. These additions would further personalize the user experience and expand the chatbot's capability to serve a broader audience. By integrating more advanced analytics, we could better understand user needs and optimize the chatbot's responses, making it an even more effective mental health resource.

## Dataset
We utilized the **Psychology-10K dataset** from Hugging Face to fine-tune our chatbot's API. This dataset includes a diverse range of psychological questions and responses, enabling our chatbot to engage users effectively. You can access the dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samhog/psychology-10k).

## Prototype
We have developed a working prototype of our chatbot, which is deployed on Streamlit. You can try it out [here] https://studentmentalhealth.streamlit.app/.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For the web application framework.
- **Google Gemini**: For natural language processing and generative AI capabilities.
- **Hugging Face**: For the Psychology-10K dataset.
